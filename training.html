<h2>Training Packages</h2>

<p>We offer several types of training packages. Whether your horse is completely green, needs a tune-up, or is starting in a new discipline, we can customize a training package to meet your needs.</p>

<h3>Full-time Training</h3>
<p>Horses in full-time training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals tailored to the owner. Full-time training includes full-board.</p>

<h3>Part-time Training</h3>
<p>Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. Part-time training can be packaged with full or partial care board.</p>

<h3>Individual Training Sessions</h3>
<p>Individual training sessions are available for both boarders and clients who would like to haul in. Individual training sessions are not packaged with board.</p>
